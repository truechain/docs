## TrueChain - a first glance
If you’re just getting started developing a brand new DApp on TrueChain, check out these resources to understand the theory behind and some of the most common patterns for getting the most benefits from TrueChain.



### Introduction - What is TrueChain

TrueChain is a truly fast, permissionless, secure and scalable permissionless blockchain platform which is supported by hybrid consensus technology called Minerva and fast growing global developer community.

TrueChain uses PBFT as fast-chain to process transactions, and leave the oversight and election of PBFT to the hands of PoW nodes. With this, TrueChain has managed to tackle the biggest challenge in public blockchain area: How to achieve de-centralization without scarifying performance. It is worth mention that TrueChain integrates fruitchain technology into the traditional PoW protocol i.e. fPoW, as the snailchain, to make the chain even more decentralized and fair. TrueChain also added sharding on top of PBFT to lift the limit of scalability.

Moreover, TrueChain is the first public blockachain to implement hybrid consensus incentive model to use economic awareness as a drive to uphold and improve the chain. Meanwhile, it also creates a stable gas fee mechanism to lower the cost for the developers and operators of DApps, and to make the blockchain more public.

As a platform, TrueChain aims to build the public blockchain to enable future de-centralized economy, which is based on the high-speed point-to-point communication, value exchange, and smart contrast infrastructure. Meanwhile, features like security, scalability, and permissionless blockchain that is free to everyone are also TrueChain’s comparative advantages.

The blockchain ecosystem and a grid of products in TrueChain can easily empower individuals or businesses to interact with blockchain, publish and manage smart contract lifecycle. TrueChain’s portfolio includes:

* **Steller** is TrueChain smart contract full lifecycle management platform
*  **Dapp Warehouse** is the de-centralized Dapp downloading platform in TrueChain
*  **TrueScan Explorer** is TrueChain’s browser.
*  **TrueChain Light Wallet** provides nodes with services such as receiving, sending and managing all TrueChain digital assets.

Great product is always developed by a great team. The team of TrueChain is international with its members from the United States, China, and India. In TrueChain research team, there are professors from leading universities, while in TrueChain engineering team, you can find ethereum community developers. So far, TrueChain developer community has attracted architects from China leading high-tech companies, and developers from Tsinghua university, Behang University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, MIT and UC Berkeley, just to name a few. Talents from the global are gathered as a virtual team in TrueChain developer community to contribute to the success of TrueChain.

As a public blockchain, TrueChain can be used in a variety of scenarios. For example, insurance, medical care, game, public welfare, asset securitization, digital advertising, micropayments, value transmission, digital copyright, just to name a few. Utilizing the node scale-out flexibility and the high efficient consensus mechanism, TrueChain can also expand its footprint in areas like mobile digital bill of exchange, securities trading, and supply chain management, property right tracking, digital certificate, etc.

With all these advantages, TrueChain has been highly recognized. For example, TrueChain is the public blockchain member of The China Cloud System Pioneer Strategic Alliance (CCOPSA). TrueChain is also among the very few blockchain projects that are reported by CCTV - the predominant state television broadcaster in China.
